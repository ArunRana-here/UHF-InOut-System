  📝 How the System Works
UHF Reader detects a tag and sends data to this API.
The API processes the tag ID and checks if it corresponds to an entry or exit event.
The system maintains a list of who is inside or outside the premises in real-time.
Data can be displayed on dashboards or integrated with other monitoring tools.
